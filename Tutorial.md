# Markdown Tutorial

This tutorial is written by me and will cover the different Markdown commands used in creating this project

# Titles

To make a title, simply put a "#" infront of the words of that title. Example, if you want a title of a paragraph to be named "Turtle", simple type "# Turtle". There must always bea  space between the "#" and the word.

# Normal Text

Text such as this is very easy because it is commandless. You can simply start typing normally in the work space and it will show up just as this text here.

# Links between markdown pages

Links start with brackets to showcase the desired display word. If you want people to click on the words, "Show me more about turtles" to see an article about turtles, then the markdown link should begin with [Show me more about turtles]

To insert the link for [Show me more about turtles] , simply add the link in between () following the bracketed display word. 

Below is a link from one of my past Markdown projects.

# Images

Images must start with the ![Display text] , the Display Text is still necessary for images because sometimes images may not load and the reader can still see its title. Following should be the (path/to/image.png "Text to show"), images work similarly to links. The difference is that Images have a alt text for the screen reader and a text to show during the mouseover of the reader.
