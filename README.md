# Final Project

# Cole Blakeman.

This is my final GIT Hub project. To demonstrate what I have learned I will be typing in bold and italicized font. I will also upload images, links, and links in between pages locally.

# About me

I am from originally from Texas and I moved to Missouri to attend Mizzou. I really enjoy it here and the community and people are very nice. I am part of the chess team and they have really changed my life in a positive way, I'v been fortunate enough to meet many people from various cultures. Most of the people on the team have become my best friends and I spend nearly every day with them. I'm very happy where I am right now at Mizzou and each day is only getting better. 

For my GIT Hub presentation I am showcasing some of my hobbies and things I enjoy doing in Mizzou. Some of my hobbies are rather new and exist solely because of the people I met here in Columbia. I hope you find what I'v written interesting.

To switch between pages use the links below, each page has its own menu list at the bottom so users do not have to go back to README.MD to switch pages. At the very bottom is the link written in HTML to come back to the homepage.
