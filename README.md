#Importance of Markdown

According to UltraEdit.com, Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc."

Markdown is nice because it is simple to use and can create easy to understand text documents such as this one.

Below is my Markdown tutorial that focuses on Markdown commands used in this project.

To switch between pages use the links below, each page has its own menu list at the bottom so users do not have to go back to README.MD to switch pages. At the very bottom is the link written in HTML to come back to the homepage.
